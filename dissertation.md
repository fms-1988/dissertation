## Ideas of work
---
1. Exist an interesting macro puzzle that is: how to model and explicate the wealth concentration since the 1980s? I sown by the first time in: [here](https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles)

2. construct a DSGE model to explain the agricultural sector of Brazil (exemple: [here](https://ier.ut.ac.ir/article_74482_a2df61a0f8c36432f39f6a40fe42aa7e.pdf)). This model wold be constructed using Jupyter and disponimibizade in Github.

3. personally I believe that the world economy don't grow because people dont want co consume. The pattern of consume is changing. Today I’m necessary more than change the design of a car to attract new consumers. The persons want things that are really new. So, two things are going on, first the people are been orientated to consume few, second there is nothing really new.

4. I have a database that contain all news about corn between the years 2015 and 2020. I can classify each news in some topics (harvest, climate, exportation, etc). then I can use them to discover which topic is more relevant to the corn price volatility. The first time that I saw this idea was in Hull (2010, page 419).

5. DSGE Model. Today half of brazilians income is expended to pay rents. 12 millions families are still paying some real estate financing. what happening if the real tax get down?

6. Mathematical model. the World is burning. Our agriculture is devastating our forest. Try to construct an incentive increase the livestock confinement instead of conventional production.

7. Would increasing brothels in a city increase the number of divorces? my hypothesis is that no. In fact it increase the number of happy families.

8. The difference-in-difference is a simple methodology and have a clear objective. I have two punctual tratament, the drivers strike and the commercial war between USA and China. How this two events affected the corn production in Brazil?

9. try to explain why the negotiation of corn future contracts in Brazil has increasing. Use the panel data to do this.

10. the number of public workers in Brazil is correlated with the low innovation?

11. the perception by the corn producers that the risk is increasing wold carry some of them to future market. this is true? try to correlate this two variables. Use the database of news and the number of contracts that are negotiated in BMF.

12. try to deconstruct the idea of technological progress in brazilian agriculture. It is evident the increase of productivity, but just to few crops. What about coffee, or orange, or sugar? the progress occurred based junt in genetic or it ocurre over other fields like agrichemicals?

13. Our society has a new problem: we don't know how to resolve the issue of technological illiteracy. To be more specific the problem pass by the social media.

14. try to apply the idea of ​​incompleteness of Godel to some axioms in microeconomics.

15. REITS in Brazil pay around 7-8% per year. This is not so much when you discover that government bonds pay approximately 7%. Why someone would choose REIT instead a bond. One reason is that REITS pay dividends and can value along the time. But this is true that a REIT survives by so much time?

16. It is really possible to predict the dollar price? this is not about to construct a model to do this. It is about analyze the different techniques and thy to conclude if it reali can be made or not.

17. Exist a monopoly in the market of interviews. Let me be more clear, today if you want to realise a big research and apply a questionnaire to the brazilian population, you probably will use the services of the company Datafolha. My idea is to figure out a new methodology that permit reduce the cost of big samples.

18. Describe alternatives to the democratic system.

19. This is probably my best idea. Imagine that did the republics figure out that what make them relevant are the people that live there. Imagine that exist free flux of peoples. So, it probably will create an incentive to the  republics compete between them. If they want to attract the best people they need to offer the best public goods. This competition between the countries would be good to the persons? Unfortunately I don't have enough math power to model this. This probably will be more important wen the homosapiens conquest the space.

20. In the beginning of my master, january of 2019, I imagined that must exist an figure to represent economics concepts, like the Philip curve with just three variables. It changed when I studied linear models and realized that they involve, generally,more than three variables and that is necessary to work in a Rn space (in a R4 you can't anymore to create graphs). It turn impossible to construct images of something that live in Rn space? no! In fact you have beautiful images to represent important concepts (like portfolio model).

21. Study crises is important because you don't specialize in just one topic (Pedro Malan)

22. What will happen with Brazil when China pass to bought soy and corn from USA?

23. How to eliminate the cars from earth?
