## Purpose
---------------------

This project was created for two reasons, first one is to guide me throw the path of dissertation, second one is to give anyone the access to my results. The versioning system of github will allow me to measure my progress and facilitate the cooperation with my advisor. By the other side, all my codes, ideas and databases will be distributed to anyone. The reason of this share is because I want to retribute the society the investment done over my studys. The other reason, this more self interested, is because I want to improve my capacity of communication. If my ideas produce nothing more than just a dissertation text, there is something wrong.
